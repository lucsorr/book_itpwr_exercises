# Write a program called name.rb that asks the user to type in their name and then prints out a greeting message with their name included.

# Modify name.rb again so that it first asks the user for their first name, saves it into a variable, and then does the same for the last name. Then outputs their full name all at once.

print "Hi! What is your first name? "
user_first_name = gets.chomp
print "And what is your second name? "
user_second_name = gets.chomp
puts "Hello, #{user_first_name + " " + user_second_name}! ðŸ™‚"

# Add another section onto name.rb that prints the name of the user 10 times. You must do this without explicitly writing the puts method 10 times in a row. 

10.times {puts user_first_name + " " + user_second_name}
