Hi! This repository contains Launch School's 'Introduction to Programming with Ruby' book exercises.

This is how my code will be organized:

1. One folder for each chapter in the book:
    e.g.: chapter01_preparations

2. One file for each exercise in each chapter:
    e.g.: c01_e01.rb

3. Other files and folders (for example, "practice_loops.rb" or "test.rb") will not be pushed to remote repository, being used for practice and note-taking.
