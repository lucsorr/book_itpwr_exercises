Hi! This repository contains the 'Introduction to Programming with Ruby' Launch School's book exercises.

This is how my code will be organized:

1. One folder for each chapter in the book:
    e.g.: chapter01_preparations

2. One file for each exercise in each chapter:
    e.g.: c01_e01.rb

3. Other files and folders (for example, "practice_loops.rb" or "test.rb") will not be pushed to remote repository for being used for my own practicing and note taking.
